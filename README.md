# Historical Sea Level Rise Analysis Changes in Python

## Introduction

### Overview of Sea Level Rise in the Last 50 Years
Over the past 50 years, global sea levels have experienced a significant rise, primarily driven by climate change and the melting of polar ice caps. According to satellite data, the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) has been rising at an average rate of about 3.4 mm per year. This acceleration in sea level rise has been particularly notable over the past two and a half decades, with approximately a third of the total increase since 1880 occurring in this period.

### Causes of Sea Level Rise
Several factors contribute to the rising sea levels, including:
- **Thermal Expansion**: As ocean temperatures rise, seawater expands, contributing to higher sea levels.
- **Melting Glaciers and Ice Sheets**: The melting of glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica adds significant amounts of freshwater to the oceans.
- **Terrestrial Water Storage**: Changes in the storage of water on land, such as groundwater depletion, can also impact sea levels.

### Impact on Global Geography and Climate
Rising sea levels pose a threat to coastal communities, leading to increased flooding, erosion, and the displacement of populations. This phenomenon also affects marine ecosystems, altering habitats and impacting biodiversity.

### Importance of Accurate Modeling and Projections
Accurate modeling and projections of sea level rise are crucial for informing policy decisions and preparing for future impacts. Visualization tools, such as LightningChart in Python, play a vital role in analyzing and communicating these changes effectively.
